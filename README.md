# Module 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview 

Summary: With the 14th project, the most difficult project and time consuming project by far. I've completed it to the best of my ability, the object-oriented programming challenge using css, javascript, test javascript, json and handlebars. This project was good to go back to because the things i learned in the second group project were similar to this module.

## User Story 

 As a junior web developer who writes about tech I WANT a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions. I have watched numerous youtube videos and zoom recordings on the UNC bootcamp website. I have reached out to my ASKBCS, TAs during my office hours, my intructor during class hours and my acaedmic advisors to get all the proper knowledge from the resources I am provided. This project has defiently got me overwhelmed moving forward into the program of the bootcamp, but was very necessary in understanding the full development of front and back end web development.

 ## Mock-Up
